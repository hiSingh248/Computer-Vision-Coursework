Assignments from Computer Vision Coursework

**H1:Histograms, Filters, Deconvolution, Blending**

The goal in this assignment is to get you acquainted with filtering in the spatial domain as well as in the frequency domain.
Laplacian Blending using Image Pyramids is a very good intro to working and thinking in frequencies, and Deconvolution is a neat trick.
You tasks for this assignment are:
- Perform Histogram Equalization on the given input image.
- Perform Low-Pass, High-Pass and Deconvolution on the given input image.
- Perform Laplacian Blending on the two input images (blend them together).

**HW2: Image Alignment, Panoramas**

Your goal is to create 2 panoramas:
- Using homographies and perspective warping on a common plane (3 images).
- Using cylindrical warping (many images).

**HW3: Detection and Tracking**

Your goal is to:
- Detect the face in the first frame of the movie
- Using pre-trained Viola-Jones detector
- Track the face throughout the movie using:
  - CAMShift
  - Particle Filter
  - Face detector + Kalman Filter
- Bonus (20pt): Face Detector + Optical Flow tracker.
